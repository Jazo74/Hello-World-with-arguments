Hello World (SI assignment)
	
Write a basic Hello World! app (create a dotnet core solution and project for this - based on this video).
Modify your program to accept command-line arguments and make it work like this
When you run the compiled program like this: dotnet run James
It should print Hello James
If you pass multiple command-line arguments to the program, like dotnet run Joe Jane Jack then it should say hello to each of them on a new line, one by one.
